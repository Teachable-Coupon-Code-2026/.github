Teachable coupon code seekers, here's something worth your attention. We've secured an exclusive deal that extends your Teachable free trial from the standard 7 days to a full 30 days.

Every deal listed below has been verified and tested. Our exclusive extended trial offer is the headline deal you won't find elsewhere.

### EXCLUSIVE: Grab 30 Days FREE (Worth $100+) – Limited Offer

**This is our exclusive deal for readers.** While Teachable's website offers just a 7-day trial, we've partnered directly to give you 30 full days free.

**What you get:** Complete access to all Teachable features for 30 days at zero cost. That's four times longer than the standard trial. Build unlimited draft products, set up payment processing, customize your school branding, create your sales pages, and even start enrolling students.

**Who this suits:** Anyone considering Teachable who wants to make an informed decision. First-time creators get time to learn. Experienced creators get time to migrate content and test thoroughly.

**How to claim:** Use our exclusive link on this page to sign up. The 30-day trial activates automatically. No coupon code needed.

**Restrictions:** Available for new Teachable accounts only. One extended trial per person.

## Why Our 30-Day Trial Beats the Standard 7-Day Offer

Let's be direct about why this exclusive deal matters.

**Standard Teachable signup:** 7 days free, then you pay.

**Our exclusive offer:** 30 days free, then you pay.

That's 23 extra days worth roughly $30-$100 depending on which plan you'd otherwise be paying for. But the real value isn't the dollar amount saved on subscription fees. It's what you can accomplish with that time.

**In 7 days, most people:**
- Explore the dashboard
- Watch some tutorials
- Maybe outline a course
- Feel rushed to decide

**In 30 days, you can actually:**
- Build your complete first course
- Design your sales page
- Set up payment processing
- Soft-launch to a test audience
- Collect real student feedback
- Make your first sales
- Know with certainty if Teachable fits your business

The extended trial transforms your decision from a guess into an informed choice backed by real experience. That's why we negotiated this deal for our readers.

## Teachable Pricing After Applying Discounts

Here's the complete pricing breakdown with exclusive annual savings calculated. All prices verified from Teachable's official website.

| Plan | Monthly Price | Discounted Annual Price | You Save | Products | Transaction Fee |
|------|---------------|-------------------------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Starter | $39/month | $29/month | $120/year | 1 | 7.5% |
| Builder | $89/month | $69/month | $240/year | 5 | 0% |
| Growth | $189/month | $139/month | $600/year | 25 | 0% |
| Advanced | $399/month | $309/month | $1,080/year | 100 | 0% |

**Understanding transaction fees:** Starter's 7.5% fee means Teachable takes $7.50 from every $100 in course sales. Sell $1,000/month and that's $75 gone. Builder and above eliminate this fee entirely. Do the math for your expected sales volume.

**All plans include:**
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- 7-day free trial (or **30 days with our exclusive link**)
- Unlimited product drafts
- AI course creation tools
- iOS and Android student apps
- Global payments and tax handling
- Upsells and cart recovery features

## Why Your Teachable Coupon Code May Not Work

Found a code elsewhere that isn't working? Here's what usually goes wrong.

**The code expired.** Most promotional codes have end dates. Old codes from outdated blog posts typically no longer work.

**Wrong billing cycle selected.** Annual discounts only apply when you choose "Billed annually." Monthly billing won't show the savings.

**New customers only.** Promotional codes almost always target new accounts. Existing users can't apply new-customer discounts.

**Case sensitivity.** Enter codes exactly as shown. "SAVE20" and "save20" might be treated differently.

**Plan-specific restrictions.** Some codes only work on certain plans. Double-check which plans qualify.

**Already used.** Single-use codes work once per account. If you've claimed it before, it won't work again.

**Our extended trial is different.** It's not a coupon code. The 30-day trial activates automatically when you sign up through our link. No code to enter, no chance of typos or expiration.

## Complete Teachable Feature Breakdown

Knowing exactly what you get helps you pick the right plan. Here's the full feature rundown.

### Course Creation Tools

Teachable's course builder handles video, text, PDFs, audio files, and quizzes. Drag-and-drop organization means no coding required. Upload content, arrange your curriculum, and publish.

AI creation tools accelerate your workflow. Teachable's built-in AI helps outline courses, suggest content structure, and generate ideas. Available on every plan.

Unlimited product drafts let you experiment freely. Create as many course concepts as you want. Only published products count against your plan limits.

The sales page builder creates high-converting landing pages without external tools. Customize templates, add testimonials, insert countdown timers, and design pages that sell.

### Student Experience

Native iOS and Android apps give students mobile access. They download Teachable's app, log into your school, and learn anywhere. You don't build or maintain anything.

Global payments handle transactions in multiple currencies. Students worldwide can purchase without currency conversion headaches on their end.

Automatic tax calculation manages VAT and sales tax compliance. Teachable handles the complexity so you focus on teaching.

### Business Growth Features

**Starter includes:** Upsells and cart recovery to capture more revenue from every visitor.

**Builder adds:** Affiliate program tools, course completion certificates, and live chat support.

**Growth adds:** White label website (remove Teachable branding), custom admin permissions for team members, and expanded product limits.

**Advanced adds:** 100 published products, priority support, and maximum flexibility.

### Platform Reliability

SSL encryption protects every transaction. Your school runs on HTTPS automatically.

Teachable handles all hosting. No servers to manage, no technical maintenance, no downtime worries during launch traffic spikes.

30-day money-back guarantee on all paid plans. Even after your free trial, you get another 30 days to request a refund if unsatisfied.

## Which Teachable Plan Should You Choose?

Here's our honest recommendation based on where you are in your journey.

### Just Starting: Grab the 30-Day Extended Trial First

Don't choose a plan yet. Use your 30-day trial to build your first course and test the platform thoroughly. You'll have real experience to inform your decision.

**Action:** Claim your extended trial through our link and start creating.

### Launching Your First Course: Grab $120 Off Starter ($29/month)

If you're testing a single course concept and want to minimize upfront costs, Starter works. You get one published product with full features.

**Watch out for:** The 7.5% transaction fee. At roughly $400/month in sales, you're paying $30 in fees. That approaches the cost difference to Builder.

**Our take:** Good for pure validation. Plan to upgrade once you're generating consistent revenue.

### Ready to Build a Business: Grab $240 Off Builder ($69/month) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

This is the sweet spot for most serious creators. Zero transaction fees mean you keep every dollar of your course sales. Five published products give room to expand your catalog.

**The math:** If you sell $900/month on Starter, your 7.5% transaction fees equal $67.50. That's nearly the entire cost of Builder. Above $900/month in sales, Builder actually saves you money.

**You also get:** Affiliate program to recruit promoters, course certificates for students, and live chat support.

**Our take:** If you're committed to building a real course business, start here. The zero transaction fee pays for itself fast.

### Scaling Multiple Products: Grab $600 Off Growth ($139/month)

Running a course catalog and need professional branding? Growth delivers 25 products, white label customization, and team permissions.

**When to upgrade:** You've maxed out Builder's 5 products, need to remove Teachable branding, or want to add team members with specific access levels.

**Our take:** Graduate to Growth when Builder's limits constrain your business.

### Enterprise Operations: Grab $1,080 Off Advanced ($309/month)

Managing 25+ products or running enterprise training? Advanced handles 100 published products with priority support.

**Our take:** Only necessary for large-scale operations. Most creators never need this tier.

## Maximizing Your Savings on Teachable

Stack these strategies to get the absolute lowest price on Teachable.

**Grab the 30-day extended trial first.** This is your biggest immediate savings. Build and validate before spending anything. [Claim it here](#).

**Lock in annual billing when you upgrade.** Discounts range from $120 (Starter) to $1,080 (Advanced) per year. Always worth it if you can pay upfront.

**Calculate your transaction fee break-even.** On Starter, you pay 7.5% of sales. When monthly fees approach $40-50, upgrading to Builder makes financial sense.

**Use the 30-day money-back guarantee.** Even after paying, you have 30 days to request a refund. Combine with your 30-day trial for 60 days of essentially risk-free testing.

**Watch for seasonal promotions.** Black Friday and Cyber Monday sometimes bring additional discounts. We'll update this page if special offers appear.

**Skip unnecessary upgrades.** Don't pay for Growth if you only have 2 products. Don't pay for Advanced if Growth covers your needs. Match your plan to your actual requirements.
